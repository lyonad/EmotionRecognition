# EmotionRecognition
This project develops a real-time emotion recognition system using Python, applying the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for emotion classification. The Pelican Optimization Algorithm enhances KNN by optimizing feature selection and tuning for better accuracy. The system processes real-time emotion data.
